SEMANTIC FIELD THEORY — COMPLETE PRIMITIVES

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LAYER 0: UNITS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Symbol
    Any physical representation of meaning.
    Examples: character, word, glyph, token, phoneme
    The atomic unit of semantic systems.

Construct
    Any defined collection of symbols.
    Examples: word, phrase, sentence, document, concept
    Constructs compose from symbols. Constructs contain constructs.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LAYER 1: STRUCTURES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Binary
    A relative decimal distribution between 0-1.
    Range: [0.000, 1.000]
    The measurement space for scalars. Continuous, not boolean.

Dichotomic
    Two constructs positioned in opposition to one another.
    Structure: construct₀ ←→ construct₁
    Opposition is semantic, not logical.

Scalar
    Two constructs mapped to a binary.
    Structure: dichotomic → binary
    Output: single value ∈ [0, 1]
    The fundamental unit of field measurement.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LAYER 2: FIELD CONCEPTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Semantic
    Pertaining to meaning as produced by the interaction
    between signal and a semantic field.

Semantic Field
    A structured space in which signal resolves into meaning.
    Its structure reflects how past meaning determines future meaning.
    Properties: curvature, density, entropy, constraint
    The field is the medium. Signals traverse it.

Signal
    Any phenomenon which changes a semantic field.
    Examples: input, prompt, context, instruction
    Signals are perturbations. The field responds.

Meaning
    The effect that signal produces on a semantic field.
    Meaning is relational, not intrinsic.

Constraint
    A limitation on possible states imposed by field structure.
    Constraint reduces entropy. Constraint is mutual.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LAYER 3: MEASURES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Tendency
    The relative curvature between two constructs.
    Measures preference/lean in a dichotomic.
    0 = total preference for construct₀
    0.5 = equilibrium
    1 = total preference for construct₁

Affinity
    Push/pull measure between two constructs.
    Measures drift direction, not preference.
    < 0.5 = repulsion (decreasing entanglement)
    = 0.5 = neutral
    > 0.5 = attraction (increasing entanglement)

Entanglement
    Synthesis magnitude between constructs.
    0 = no entanglement (total separation)
    0.5 = pure magnitude (no intrinsic meaning)
    1 = maximal entanglement (total synthesis)
    No negative values. No opposition implied.

Semantic Entropy
    Uncertainty in how signal resolves to meaning.
    0 = minimal uncertainty (overconstrained)
    0.5 = balanced uncertainty (nominal)
    1 = maximal uncertainty (diffuse, chaotic)
    The variance of the field.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LAYER 4: FIELD PROPERTIES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Curvature
    The shape of probability distribution around a point.
    0 = flat (roams freely)
    1 = sharp (locked to mean)
    How tightly the field bends toward attractors.

Well
    A region of elevated affinity. System-wide attractor.
    < 0.5 = repulsion well (system pushes away)
    = 0.5 = neutral
    > 0.5 = attraction well (system gravitates toward)

Basin
    A weak attractor region. Local minimum in field topology.

Drift
    Movement through the field over time.
    The tendency for values to shift absent signal.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LAYER 5: DYNAMICS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Perturbation
    A change to the field caused by signal.
    The mechanism by which input alters state.

Resolution
    The process by which signal collapses into meaning.
    The field settling after perturbation.

Decay
    The fading of affinity absent signal.
    Relationships drift without maintenance.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE FIVE LAWS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. A semantic field changes only through Signal.
2. Meaning resolves toward certainty.
3. Constraint is mutual.
4. Constraint reduces Semantic Entropy.
5. Affinity decays absent Signal.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE 0/0.5/1 AXIOM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Only 0, 0.5, and 1 have intrinsic semantic meaning.
All other values are interpolations between these anchors.

    0   = pole (total, absence, or minimum)
    0.5 = equilibrium (neutral, balanced)
    1   = pole (total, presence, or maximum)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCALAR CLASSES (4 CANONICAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[1] TENDENCY        Preference between constructs (behavioral)
[2] AFFINITY        Gravitational relationship (relational)
[3] ENTANGLEMENT    Synthesis magnitude (structural)
[4] ENTROPY         Field variance (systemic)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TENDENCY SUBTYPES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Duality           Maps two literary/conceptual opposites
Antithetical      Maps two structurally polar opposites
Absence           Maps one construct against a void of itself
Operational       Any other dichotomic mapping
